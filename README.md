# CS50 Final Project
This is our repository for the CS50 course Final Project

## Motivation

The project's goal is to introduce a way to control your plastic footprint everytime you shop in a supermarket.

## Description

There is a shop page that is responsible for registring a client's shopping list.

Each registred client can acces its own page anytime and check the current monthly plastic balance.

Each product has a price as well as a plastic weight, which is accumulated with all the monthly shopping and taxed according to a government table everytime the monthly plastic consumption is above 0.5Kg.

|  Range    |  Price  |
| 0Kg-0.5Kg |    0eur |
| 0.5Kg-1Kg |    5eur |
| 1Kg-2Kg   |   15eur |
|    >2Kg   |   30eur |
